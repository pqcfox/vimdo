vimdo
=====

Overview
--------

Vimdo is a small tool to create and manage to-do lists (and lists in general). It is modal, with keybindings reminiscient of Vim, although users are encouraged to remap the keybindings to suit their own tastes. Vimdo is currently ALPHA and should not be used in a production environment (e.g., to store real notes that you care about). Contributions are welcome; Vimdo is written in Common Lisp using cl-termbox, and as it does not currently make heavy use of macros or closures the codebase should be fairly easy to understand.
